# FraudLens Technical Architecture

## System Architecture Overview

FraudLens implements a modern, multi-layered architecture designed for scalability, performance, and maintainability. The system consists of four primary components:

1. **Data Layer**: Manages data ingestion, transformation, and storage
2. **Analysis Layer**: Provides pattern recognition and similarity detection
3. **Visualization Layer**: Transforms data into interactive visual insights
4. **Interface Layer**: Delivers the user experience and interaction model

## Component Details

### Data Layer
- Database abstraction with SQLAlchemy for provider flexibility
- Custom data loaders for multiple fraud data sources
- ETL pipeline for standardizing diverse fraud schemas
- Modular fallback system ensuring application functionality

### Analysis Layer
- Machine learning models for pattern detection
- Statistical analysis for trend identification
- Time-series forecasting for fraud prediction
- Similarity algorithms for case matching

### Visualization Layer
- Interactive charts and graphs for temporal analysis
- Choropleth maps for geographical insights
- Network diagrams for relationship visualization
- Heatmaps for multi-dimensional data representation

### Interface Layer
- Streamlit-based web application
- Multi-page navigation system
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Responsive design for various devices

## Technical Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Python**: Primary development language
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data processing and manipulation
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Plotly**: Advanced data visualization
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM and abstraction
- **Scikit-learn**: Pattern recognition and machine learning

### Data Flow

1. Raw fraud data is ingested from various sources (custom files, databases)
2. Data is standardized into a common schema through the ETL pipeline
3. Analysis components process standardized data to extract patterns and insights
4. Visualization layer renders interactive charts based on processed data
5. Interface layer facilitates user interaction with all system components

## Deployment Model

The architecture supports multiple deployment scenarios:

- **Development**: Local environment with simplified database
- **Testing**: Containerized deployment with test datasets
- **Production**: Cloud-based deployment with secured database connection

## Security Considerations

- Database credentials managed through environment variables
- Data sanitization at all input boundaries
- Authentication and authorization framework
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
